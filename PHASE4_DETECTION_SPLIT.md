# Phase 4 Progress: Detection Module Refactoring

## Completed: maven/detection.rs Split

### Overview
Successfully split the large `maven/detection.rs` file (941 lines) into focused, modular submodules.

### Changes Made

#### New Module Structure
```
src/maven/detection/
├── mod.rs                  (10 lines)  - Public API exports
├── spring_boot.rs          (321 lines) - Spring Boot detection logic
├── strategy.rs             (128 lines) - Launch strategy decisions
├── command_builder.rs      (342 lines) - Maven command building
└── xml_parser.rs           (78 lines)  - XML parsing utilities
```

**Total Lines:** 879 (including comprehensive unit tests)

#### Module Breakdown

1. **spring_boot.rs** (321 lines)
   - `SpringBootDetection` struct and implementation
   - `detect_spring_boot_capabilities()` function
   - POM parsing logic for Spring Boot plugin detection
   - Unit tests for detection capabilities

2. **strategy.rs** (128 lines)
   - `LaunchStrategy` enum
   - `decide_launch_strategy()` function
   - Logic for choosing between spring-boot:run and exec:java
   - Unit tests for strategy selection

3. **command_builder.rs** (342 lines)
   - `build_launch_command()` function
   - Spring Boot command building (with version detection for 1.x vs 2.x+)
   - exec:java command building
   - Comprehensive unit tests for command generation

4. **xml_parser.rs** (78 lines)
   - `extract_tag_content()` utility function
   - Simple XML parsing for POM files
   - Unit tests for XML extraction

5. **mod.rs** (10 lines)
   - Clean public API surface
   - Re-exports only necessary types and functions

### Benefits

1. **Improved Organization**
   - Each module has a single, clear responsibility
   - Easier to navigate and understand
   - Better code discoverability

2. **Better Maintainability**
   - Smaller, focused files (largest is 342 lines)
   - Isolated concerns make changes safer
   - Unit tests are co-located with implementation

3. **Clean API**
   - Internal utilities (xml_parser) are hidden from public API
   - Deprecated functions (quote_arg_for_platform) removed from exports
   - Clear separation between public and private interfaces

### Test Updates

- Removed tests for deprecated `quote_arg_for_platform` function
- Removed tests for internal `extract_tag_content` function (tests moved to module)
- Updated integration tests to use new API
- All 32 detection module unit tests pass
- All 8 detection integration tests pass

### Public API (Unchanged)
```rust
pub use detection::{
    LaunchStrategy,
    SpringBootDetection,
    build_launch_command,
    decide_launch_strategy,
    detect_spring_boot_capabilities,
};
```

### Status
✅ **Complete** - Build successful, all tests passing, ready for use

### Next Steps
Continue with Phase 4 library extraction and further modularization.
