# Versioning Strategy

LazyMVN uses a hybrid versioning system for releases and nightly builds.

## Version Format

### Release Builds
- Format: `X.Y.Z` (e.g., `0.4.0`)
- Manually set in `Cargo.toml`
- Tagged in git with `vX.Y.Z`
- Built from `main` branch

### Nightly Builds
- Format: `X.Y.Z-unstable (commit: HASH, built: DATE)`
- Example: `0.4.0-unstable (commit: 357c14e, built: 2025-10-21)`
- Automatically built from `develop` branch
- Git commit hash and build date injected at compile time

## How It Works

The version string is generated at **compile time** using a build script (`build.rs`):

1. **Git Hash**: `git rev-parse --short HEAD` â†’ captures current commit
2. **Build Date**: Current UTC date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format
3. **Version**: Reads from `Cargo.toml`

These are combined into a compile-time constant in `main.rs`.

## Checking Your Version

```bash
# Short version (release only)
lazymvn --version

# Shows full version with commit and date
lazymvn --version
```

**Output examples:**

```
# Release build
lazymvn 0.4.0 (commit: a1b2c3d, built: 2025-10-21)

# Nightly build
lazymvn 0.4.0-unstable (commit: 357c14e, built: 2025-10-21)
```

## For Contributors

### Manual Releases
1. Update version in `Cargo.toml`
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md`
3. Commit with message: `chore: bump version to X.Y.Z`
4. Tag: `git tag vX.Y.Z`
5. Push: `git push && git push --tags`

### Nightly Builds (Automatic)
- Push to `develop` branch
- GitHub Actions automatically builds and uploads to nightly release
- No manual version updates needed
- Commit hash identifies the exact code version

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Nightly Workflow (`.github/workflows/nightly.yml`)
- Triggers on push to `develop`
- Builds for Linux and Windows
- `build.rs` injects git hash and build date
- Uploads binaries to GitHub release tagged `nightly`

### Release Workflow (`.github/workflows/rust.yml`)
- Triggers on tags matching `v*`
- Builds production binaries
- Creates GitHub release with changelog
